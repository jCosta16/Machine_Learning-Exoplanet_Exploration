# machine-learning-challenge


Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I createed a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

Below you can find a report with a comparison of two model's performance as well as a summary about my findings and assumptions based on the model with the best performance.
